# react-boilerplate-site-with-bootstrap

Are you a React beginner who just wants to quickly build a simple website using ReactJS, Sass, Bootstrap and some basic page navigation?

**Then this project will get you started quickly.**

* This is a project that's been created using Create-React-App. I've added CSS Preprocessing(Sass) and Bootstrap.
* A few components and pages have been added to start building in.
* React Router(v4) has been added to help with site navigation - a menu component with a couple of links have been added as a starting point.
